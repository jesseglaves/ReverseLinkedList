# ReverseLinkedList

## Description
This project provides a C# implementation for **reversing a singly linked list**. It includes:

- **ListNode class**: Defines a node with an integer value (`Val`) and a reference to the next node (`Next`).
- **ReverseList method**: Iteratively reverses the linked list by updating the `Next` pointers and returns the new head.
- **PrintList method**: Outputs the values of the linked list nodes in sequence.
- **Main method**: Demonstrates usage by creating a list (`1 → 2 → 3`), reversing it, and printing the result (`3 2 1`).

This example is useful for understanding linked list manipulation in C#.

## How to Run
1. Open in Visual Studio or run with `dotnet` CLI.
2. Build and run the `Program.cs` file.

## Output
Example output is printed to the console.
